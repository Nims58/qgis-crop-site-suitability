about=Site Suitability Analysis Plugin offers an easy to use, equal weighted overlay method to derive suitable sites for crop mapping. It streamlines the process by integrating reclassification and threshold-based analysis into a single, user-friendly workflow. Unlike other general-purpose suitability tools, this solution is tailored specifically for crop mapping, making it easier for users to set thresholds and perform the analysis without extensive configuration.
